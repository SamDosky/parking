# parking

the project requirements

You have recently been thinking of going into business.  It has always been your dream to own a parking lot in the city.  You recently went and bought a very large underground facility and are almost ready for opening day!

Design a program that models a parking lot.

You should have the relevant data structures (more than one perhaps depending if they park their car or an attendant does, etc.).  You can use collections, but you must also create your own generic class and create your own data structure.

Make sure to put in data.  You will also need to analyze the cars coming into your lot using lambdas and streams to sift out interesting and relevant information.

You should be able to do things like sort data (you should write your own sorting methods, use comparators and iterators).  

This should be a real world design, so think of all the possibilities and how you would deal with them.

at least 10 objects that are implemented and run in main.
